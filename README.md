# Dijkstras_Algorithm

Overview :  Here in this project i implemented Dijkstra's algorithm in C++, the main aim of algorithm is to find the shortest distance between two nodes, Where as in the code 
            the cities are represented as nodes in a graph, and the nodes are connecting them as weighted edges. The working of the program is, if a user enter two inputs one is starting location and destination then the 
            algorithm will return the calculated shortest path and total travel cost.
